# Section 8 Grouping - 8.01 Array

An array is really a building block in Go. In the example below, we are creating an array of 5 integers, `[0,0,0,0,0]`

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var x [5]int
	fmt.Println(x)
}

```  
  
We can specify a value at an index position as well, `x[3] = 42`, which gives us `[0 0 0 42 0]`  

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var x [5]int
	fmt.Println(x)
	x[3] 42
	fmt.Println(x)
}

```
  
Arrays use what's called a [zero-based index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering), which just means they start at 0 and work up, so in our array `x`, `x[0]` is the first index, `x[1]` the second, and so on.  
  
In [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#arrays), it says,  
  
"Arrays are useful when planning the detailed layout of memory and sometimes can help avoid allocation, but primarily they are a building block for slices, the subject of the next section. To lay the foundation for that topic, here are a few words about arrays."  
  
Then, just before the [Slices](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#slices) section, it says,  
  
"Use slices instead."  
  
An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type. The length is part of the array's type.
