# Section 8 Grouping - 8.02 Slice - Composite Literal  
  
In this section we are taking values of different types (or even values of a certain type) and putting them into one data structure, this can sometimes be called aggregate data.  
  
From Wikipedia, on [composite data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type), "In computer science, a composite data type or compound data type is any data type which can be constructed in a program using the programming language's primitive data types and other composite types. It is sometimes called a structure or aggregate data type,[1] although the latter term may also refer to arrays, lists, etc."  
  
So, a _composite_ data type taking any types, or values of different types and composing them together, and we have the struct to do that, which is why it's sometimes called a struct. In Go we have a type called a struct which allows us to compose values of different types together.  
  
Composite data type and aggregate are kind of the same thing. A composite is referring to a data structure, like a struct which can hold values of different types, whereas aggregate refers to something like an array or a slice, where they are holding values of the same type. 
  
In this example of a slice, we use a [composite literal](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Composite_literals). A composite literal is where we can create different values of this type where we compose a bunch of values together.  

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// COMPOSITE LITERAL
	x := []int{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 42}
	fmt.Println(x)
}

// a SLICE allows you to group together VALUES of the same TYPE

```
