# Section 8 Grouping - 8.05 Slice - Appending to a Slice  
  
Effective Go describes the signature of append [append](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#append) as `func append(slice []T, elements ...T) []T`. 
    
`...` before something, as in the `...T` in the type signature of `append` is a variadic parameter. A [variadic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function) is a function of indefinite arity, i.e., one which accepts a variable number of arguments.  
  
`...` after something, such as the `y...` in `x = append(x, y...)` will _unfurl_ or return a list of values within a data structure, rather than the data structure.  

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := []int{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 42}
	x = append(x, 77, 88, 99, 1014)
	fmt.Println(x)

	y := []int{234, 456, 987}
	x = append(x, y...)

	fmt.Println(x)
}

```
